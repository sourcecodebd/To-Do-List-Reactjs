# To-Do-List-Reactjs
Hi I have made a simple app using React JS, where I have implemented simple API related work, fetched data from To-Do Open API and differentiated them according to their state, shown ratings (using React-Rating), finished and unfinished task and their details separately using React Router DOM.  Used Material UI, Tailwind CSS, React Bootstrap and custom CSS as Design framework. Check it out!
